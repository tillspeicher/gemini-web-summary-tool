## Installation and start

1. Install dependencies with `pnpm install`.
2. Start the dev server with `pnpm dev`. This will open a Chrome browser window with the extension enabled.
3. Select and remember text on websites. If the front- and backend are running, the highlighted text should appear there.

### Debugging Tips

1. [MacOS] If the extension does not work, try to activate the Firewall in the network settings and then add `node` to it by the following command:
   `sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --add /usr/local/bin/node`
